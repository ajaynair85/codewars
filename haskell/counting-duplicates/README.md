### Count the number of Duplicates

Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters that occur more than once in the given string. The given string can be assumed to contain only uppercase and lowercase alphabets.

### Example

"abcde" -> 0 ```# no characters repeats more than once```

"aabbcde" -> 2 ```# 'a' and 'b'```

"aabbcdeB" -> 2 ```# 'a' and 'b'```

"indivisibility" -> 1 ```# 'i'```

"Indivisibilities" -> 2 ```# 'i' and 's'```
